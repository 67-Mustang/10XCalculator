Hello I am Steven Shivayka the Creator of the 10X Calculator. I do not have any formal training in C++ but I have done extensive self study and am always learning.
Currently I am reading C++ Primer which I purchased off Amazon. It has many examples and practice. I also follow courses on youtube and linkedinlearning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope you enjoy this program. It was made in C++ and is free to use.
